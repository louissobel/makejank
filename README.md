makejank
=========

Build system for janky one page web apps
----------

You should still be able to develop them well, even if it has to end up as one file


Two ways of using:

 - with a Jankfile
 - ad hoc

With jankfile:

`makejank [-t target] [options]` - all options specified in Jankfile, can be overrided CLI

Without jankfile

`makejank <source> [options]` - to stdout
